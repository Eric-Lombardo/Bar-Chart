day 1:
  - 2 hours
  - started project and began using bootstrap to quickly mock up
    how I wanted my bar graph to look like. I'm not sure if I'll 
    continue using bootstrap in my code as i realize I won't need it
    since I can probably do without it for now.
  - My biggest struggle today was trying to figure out how to get 
    my coloumns to grow from the bottom to the top. Right now it seems
    like the default is for the div to grow from the top to the bottom.
    I researched the problem and the solution seems to be to include in
    the CSS vertical-align: bottom, but i think Bootstrap is overriding 
    this even though my css file is loaded after the bootstrap CDN. This
    is why i'll most likely remove bootstrap from this project.

day2:
  - 3 hours
  - I found out that flexbox is a baked in property in CSS so I decided
    to get rid of Bootstrap since that was the primary reason why I wanted 
    to use it. Then i spent my time refactoring my code to make a mock-up
    of how i want my bargraphs to be displayed. It looks ugly I know ...
    but for now it's all about function and styling can come later. I hope
    this doesn't come back to haunt me.
  - Today's biggest struggle would be design. I kept on trying to get my code
    to look like how i sketched out my design on paper. It's sort of getting
    there. Also I wanted to add ticks to my y-axis by using border-bottom, but
    that adds to the height and increases the size the chart making the ticks
    no longer at the same level of the bars.

day3:
  - 3 hours
  - I have found a better solution for completing this project. While doing research
    for how to use flexbox i came across the grid system. After watching some videos
    by Wes Bos on youtube and completing a CSS grid game online i felt confident enough
    to use this system in constructing a bargraph. I went ahead and created a template,
    that i will use as a basis of how i want the UI to look like.
  - Honestly the grid system made sense to me pretty quickly, so no struggles today.

day4: SUCCESS I GOT A WORKING BUILD!!!!
  - 5 hours
  - I decided to get rid of jQuery as well and only focus on manipulating
    the DOM in JS. Everything came together by focusing on smaller chunks
    of the overall problem. I know that some of the code can be refactored
    to contain less writing but it works for now.
  - next step is to allow user customization.

day5:
  - 3 hours
  - added user inut styling for many things such as:
    - bar color
    - display bar values ****needs more research*****
    - add title and customize font size and color and bottom spacing
    - the ability to stylize the y axis ticks
    - change overall background color of chart
    - choose the spacing between the bars
  - My biggest struggle today is to figure out how to place the values
    of each bar in terms of top, bottom or middle. I am only able to
    set it to the top for now. I tried using align-text but that didn'to
    seem to have an effect because it always chooses the top cell. I
    thought of targetting a specific cell for example if the user chooses
    middle, i would take math.cieling of bar value divided by 2. However,
    from the little research i did targetting a specfic cell is not possible.

day5 - Continued:
  - 40 minutes
  - added the ability to the user to specifiy the y axis start value as 
    well as the step increase for each y axis tick.
  - I toyed with the idea of making an option where the user can specify
    if they want to include the maximum  y value even if it's not at a
    multiple of their desired step increase but it made the graph look
    wierd so i decided against adding this feature. 

day6:
  - 2 hours
  - added a bunch of styling options:
    - ability to choose font family
    - ability to change the background color of labels
    - ability to change text color of labels
    - control the width of master element
    - ability to place a border around master element

day7:
  - 1 hours
  - made it possible to use google custom fonts by adding a function
    that would create a link in the head of the HTML document with the
    url of the google font.

day7 - Continued:
  - 6 hours
  - Refactored some code to be able to include stacked bar graphs. I created 
    some helper functions for example sorting the given array in descending 
    order so that i can later create each bar with the less-value bar going
    on top of the "stack" so that the background colors for each bar shows
    on the webpage. Also when the user chooses stacked bar graph the labels
    for each bar now show on the bar itself and as always still includes the
    value for that bar.
  - biggest hurdle today was that it took me a long time to realize that when
    sorting an array in descending order and then assign it to a new variable
    it will mutate the original array. That caused a problem when i was trying 
    to assign a spefic color from obj.barColorArr using the .indexOf method from
    the original array.

dat7 - Continued
  - 30 minutes
  - made sure to remove unnecessary grid columns when user selects stack graph
